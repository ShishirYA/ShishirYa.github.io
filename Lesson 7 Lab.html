<h1> My name is Shishir Yasmali</h1>
<p>I am an early graduate from leesville road highschool and i started college early in hopes of having better chances to study cyber security better. 
I am new to coding and i would like to learn with the help of wake tech and the professors. In my free time i do play a lot of video games but i will
be changing that in hopes of learning and picking up stuff faster.</p>
